setup
Download the aind-environment-unix.yml file at the bottom of this page (right click, save file).
conda env create -f aind-environment-unix.yml to create the environment.
then source activate aind to enter the environment.
Install the development version of hmmlearn 0.2.1 with a source build:
 pip install git+https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn.git. If you are having trouble on this step feel free to skip ahead. 
 You'll only need this for hmmlearn in the very last project.
